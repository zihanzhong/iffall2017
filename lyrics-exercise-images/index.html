	<p class="a">
		<i>[Intro: Lana Del Rey]</i>
		<br>
		Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
		<br>
		My summer wine is really made from all these things
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>[Verse 1: Barrie James O'Neill]</i>
		<br>
		I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
		<br>
		A song that I had only sang to just a few
		<br>
		She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
		<br>
		And I will give to you summer wine
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Oh, Summer wine</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p class="b">
		<i>[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]</i>
		<br>
		Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
		<br>
		My summer wine is really made from all these things
		<br>
		Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
		<br>
		And I will give to you summer wine
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Mm, Summer wine</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p class="c">
		<i>[Verse 2: Barrie James O'Neill]</i>
		<br>
		My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
		<br>
		I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
		<br>
		She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
		<br>
		And then she gave to me more summer wine
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Mm, Summer wine</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]</i>
		<br>
		Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
		<br>
		My summer wine is really made from all these things
		<br>
		Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
		<br>
		And I will give to you summer wine
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Mm, Summer wine</h2>
