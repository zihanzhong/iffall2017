	<h1>Feedback for Matt</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Overall, I like the color choices and how it matches with the image</li>
		<li>the opacity of the text could be more unify</li>
		<li>contrast between the quote and the contributor could be clearer</li>
		<li>have quotation mark or not</li>
		<li>images in mobile versions are kind of low resolution</li>
		<li>more consistency through out the whole six panels (weight, color)</li>
		<li>for the good good one, how the image is cropped could be reconsider.</li>
	</ul>
